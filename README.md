# AnalyzingOzoneLevels
In this R project, I conducted an analysis of ozone levels in New York for 1973 using the airquality dataset included with RStudio. The missing values in the ozone levels were replaced with the mean of the rest of the values. I also calculated the average ozone levels for each month using a loop.
