# AnalyzingOzoneLevels
This project involves an analysis of ozone levels in New York for the year 1973 using R. The aim is to handle missing data and understand the distribution of ozone levels throughout the months.

## Project Overview
The project is built using R and incorporates ggplot2 for data visualization

It includes the following steps:
* Cleaning the data by replacing missing ozone values with the mean
* Visualizing the distribution of ozone levels using a bar graph
* Calculating average ozone levels for each month using a loop

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the airquality dataset from RStudio, which contains daily readings of ozone levels, wind speed, solar radiation, and other variables.

## Model Evaluation
The evaluation of the ozone level analysis is primarily focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization.
